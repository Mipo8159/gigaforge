Giga asked (2026-10-02) for Claude to keep a standing parallel-work mindset and
help them learn it: worktrees, background tasks, and separate agent roles for
analyze → fix → test → review. A one-line "this could run in a worktree" is not
enough; propose the **concrete split** before starting.

**Why:** in a two-bug, two-repo debugging session everything ran serially in one
context. Two log sweeps hit the 2-minute foreground timeout before being moved to
the background, a private-DB connection hung for 2 minutes, and the UI half
(a 6-line change in a second repo) waited for the backend investigation it did
not depend on. Giga rated the session ~7/10 and named this as the gap.

**How to apply.** In the first reply to a multi-part task, add a short
"Split" block mapping each phase to a tool, then launch the parts that are
Claude's to launch:

| Phase | Default tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Analyze, broad (logs, many files, docs) | `Explore` / `researcher` subagent, or Bash `run_in_background` | Anything that may exceed ~60 s or floods context. Keep the conclusion, not the dump. |
| Analyze, narrow (one code path) | main session | Subagents start cold; don't spawn for a 3-file read. |
| Fix, independent halves (backend vs UI repo) | separate worktree, launched by Giga: `cd <repo> && claude -w <task>` | Name the moment and the command; Giga launches it so they practise it. |
| Test / verify | background task or `claude -p` one-shot | Long builds, migrations, E2E runs. |
| Review | `reviewer` subagent in the background | Over ~100 lines, or auth/money/data/infra (CORE.md rule). |

Rules:
- **Check access before the first probe:** SSO fresh, VPN or bastion for private
  DBs, browser extension connected. Ask for all of them in the opening question
  batch, not one by one as each fails.
- **Argue the split.** Parallelism has costs: cold-start context, merge
  conflicts, and Giga's attention. Say which part stays serial and why. A small
  single-file fix does not get a worktree.
- **Separate agent configs** live in `gigaforge/global/agents/`. Only
  `researcher` and `reviewer` exist today. Propose a new role (for example a
  `verifier` that reruns a repro and reports evidence) only when a session shows
  it would have been used, never pre-emptively.
