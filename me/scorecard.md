# AI-usage scorecard

Re-scored **monthly** with Claude, using evidence (prompt history, harvest
signals below), never vibes. The goal is the trend, not any single number.

## Baseline — 2026-10-01 (≈ 20–25% of available leverage)

Evidence: 958 prompts / 126 sessions, 2026-06-01 → 2026-10-01; tool logs of the
59 transcripts still on disk.

| # | Dimension | 2026-10 | Evidence at baseline | Target behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Domain / intent in prompts | 8 | rich feature specs (transactions, enums, edge cases) | keep |
| 2 | Customisation (memory, skills) | 6 | 7 custom skills, shared memory, asked for build-loop | brain + curation loop running |
| 3 | Done-criteria & verification | 2 | "criteria" ×0, "verify" ×2; "is everything set?", "that's it?" | every task has "done when…" + proof |
| 4 | Debugging style | 3 | "help me fix this" + paste; "so what is the problem?" | expected/actual/hypothesis; Claude reproduces |
| 5 | Context management | 3 | /clear ×1, /compact ×1, exit ×45, /usage ×29 | one goal per session; fresh context; right model |
| 6 | Parallel work | 0 | no worktrees, no parallel sessions | 2–3 sessions in worktrees routinely |
| 7 | Enforcement (hooks, permissions) | 1 | no hooks; rules only as advisory memory | rules that must hold are hooks/permissions |
| 8 | Project instructions (CLAUDE.md) | 0 | none, incl. clasico (~570 prompts) | every active repo has a lean CLAUDE.md |
| 9 | Review pass | 1 | /code-review, /simplify never used | reviewer subagent on every non-trivial diff |
| 10 | Automation (headless, CI, schedule) | 0 | claude -p, GitHub Action, /schedule unused | ≥1 recurring automated job |
| 11 | Learning from AI | 3 | Claude wrote 100% of issue-flow | tutor mode in labs; Giga writes the core |

## Prompt-signal trend (`bin/signals-report.py`)

Baseline, replayed from history through the coach heuristics (2026-10-02).
They're rough regex signals: read the direction, not the decimals.

| month | prompts | done% (↑) | no_done (↓) | debug_no_hypothesis (↓) | asks_status (↓) | vague (↓) | multi_task (↓) | research (↓) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-06 | 222 | 10% | 31% | 10% | 0% | 2% | 0% | 0% |
| 2026-07 | 85 | 16% | 19% | 5% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 1% |

## Session signals (appended by /retro)

| Date | Project | Done-criteria | Plan | Debug style | Proof | Subagents/parallel | Review | Giga coded |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-02 | client (onboard + price unit change) | no (Claude proposed) | yes (plan + 1 question batch) | n.a. | yes (schema script, throwaway-DB migration test) | Explore sweep, background reviewer; Giga asked for agents | yes, reviewer found rollout risks | no |
| 2026-10-02 | client (2-bug debug, 2 repos) | no | yes (one question batch, then autonomous) | "what changed" given; no IDs/error/hypothesis | yes (SDQA logs + URL-shape check; post-deploy rerun pending) | none during debug (serial; 2 log sweeps timed out in foreground); then built a `verifier` agent (generic + client override), proven with per-dir `claude -p` probes | no (diff ~21 lines) | no |
| 2026-10-02 | client (role-gated field edit, 2 repos) | yes, but not checkable ("without any issues"); no access | yes (2-question batch, then autonomous) | n.a. | partial (build/lint/tsc; live API+UI proof pending core + login) | background reviewer in parallel with the wait; Giga asked for agentic | yes, reviewer confirmed the fix and found a role-escalation path + secrets in README | no |
| 2026-10-02 | client (OAuth consent-dialog domain, analysis) | yes on 2nd prompt ("definitive answer whether backend can do it"); 1st was "analyze following" | n.a. | n.a. | partial (code read + order-of-events; device check pending) | none (3 small greps, serial) | no (no diff) | no |
| 2026-10-02 | client (onboard remote-only server workspace) | n.a. (skill invocation; Claude stated proof: hook test table) | yes (one 4-question batch) | n.a. | yes (11-case guard table, all pass after a `\b` fix) | none (empty folder, nothing to sweep) | no (diff <100 lines) | no |
| 2026-10-02 | client (push-repo explainer → review-result push feature) | yes, counted ("2 rejects + 1 approval = 3 pushes"); env/access came later | yes (recommendation table + 4-question batch, then autonomous) | n.a. | yes (local 3-job run, 409 control, prod image build; FCM topic dry-run handed to Giga) | background reviewer; verifier + researcher in parallel; secrets skill; Giga asked "always squeeze agents/skills/hooks" | yes, reviewer found retry-resends-after-send | no |
| 2026-10-03 | gigaforge (ECC analysis → library absorb → kit + guard + rollout to 10 projects) | partly (goal + time budget; no done-line, no action boundaries) | yes (Claude plan + one 4-question batch, then autonomous) | n.a. | yes (167-case selftest, mutation checks, real `claude -p` probes, dry-run before every apply) | heavy: 4 analysis agents, 6 forks, claude-code-guide doc check, 4 background reviews (25+ issues found and fixed) | yes, 4 reviewer passes | no |
| 2026-10-04/05 | client (onboarding audit → region-scoping fix + channel scope bug → push-review re-verify) | yes on the region task (decidable done) but no env/access (SSO expired) and scope added after proof; push re-check had an env boundary ("local only") | yes (3-question batch with a recommendation, then autonomous) | n.a. | yes (10-check + chain run on a side-port bundle, mismatching-header proof, 56 offline text checks with control, Redis-MONITOR job capture; all test data cleaned) | none (serial, small diffs; Claude found an existing feature mostly done) | no (diffs <100 lines; authz-adjacent but consistency-only) | no |
| 2026-10-04/05 | client (cloud-CRM integration scoping → ERP SQL discovery → incremental CSV exporter) | no on the build prompt (Claude stated proof first; Giga chose options via 4-question batch); VPN access dropped 3× mid-task | yes (one 4-question batch, then autonomous build/test/fix) | n.a. (auth failure: Claude did the shape-diff late, after 4 lockout attempts) | yes (23 offline tests; live: counts = DB, rerun emits 0, store-day revenue = payments per store to the tetri) | background reviewer during VPN wait; researcher not used (Claude did live web checks inline) | yes, reviewer found 1 blocker + 11 should-fix, all fixed with tests | no |
| 2026-10-05 | gigaforge (scout ECC-like learning repos → candidates README + plan) | no (2 prompts no_done; Claude stated the proof: check-library + secret scan) | n.a. (research; Claude led with a recommendation, then waited for a go) | n.a. | yes (GitHub API facts for 30 repos, licence-file check, check-library 0 failures, scan clean) | none (serial research; phase 1 planned as 3 parallel forks) | no (docs only) | no |
| 2026-10-05 | gigaforge (capability/gap assessment → roadmap + coach milestone) | no ("move me to perfection"; Claude replaced it with scorecard targets + per-phase proofs) | yes (plan + one 4-question batch, then autonomous) | n.a. | yes (4 coach-hook probes incl. missing-roadmap fallback, signals to a temp file; secret scan clean) | none (small serial diff; a parallel session wrote a second plan the same day, now linked) | no (diff <100 lines) | no |
| 2026-10-05 | client (one-line default flip: creator channels published on create) | partly (clear target, no done-line; old rows and visibility left open) | n.a. (no questions; Claude flagged the backfill and empty-channel visibility at the end) | n.a. | partly (tsc + eslint clean; no curl, serve bundle stale) | none (trivial serial change) | no (1-line diff) | no |
